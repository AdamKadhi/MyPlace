Sure! Here are some ideas for your personal website:

A to-do list: This could be a simple page where you can add, edit, and mark off tasks as you complete them. You could even include features like due dates and prioritization.

An events calendar: This could be a page where you can add, view, and edit events and appointments. You could also include a feature that sends reminders before an event.

A journal or blog: This could be a place where you can write about your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. You could also include photos and videos to make it more interesting.

A recipe book: If you enjoy cooking, you could create a page where you can store and share your favorite recipes. You could include a search feature to help people find specific recipes.

A photo gallery: This could be a page where you can upload and share photos with friends and family. You could create albums and tags to organize your photos.
